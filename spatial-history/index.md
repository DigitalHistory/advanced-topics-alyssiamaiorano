# Early Modern Royal Hospitals: Social, Political and Religious Turmoil
#### Illness On The Outskirts of Early Modern London

The placement of early modern London hospitals are purposeful and strategic, and in line with popular opinion
regarding mental and physical illnesses. The position of these hospitals on a modern map is, perhaps, expected,
as the city has grown substantially around them since the 1530 dissolution of the monasteries. The bounds of
London expanded to include Westminster and areas below the River Thames into the modern era. In the 1530s when
Royal Hospitals, that aided the sick *and*  the criminal, after church hospitals (and all other charity programs
operated by the church) were dissolved, were founded, fears of the spread of infectious disease and plagues was
heightened.[^1] (Plague on a Page) In relation to what were considered immoral illnesses, such as venereal diseases like syphilis,
commonly referred to in the period as "the pox," these fears of disease grew. Through the fear of disease,
and early modern ideas of health and medicine, London moved its care to the peripheries.

The Royal Hospitals that were reinstated by the City of London were Bethlem Hospital, Saint Barthomew, Saint Thomas, and BrideWell Hospital and Prison. These hospitals
were located at the outermost parts of London, what is now The City of London.
Situated near brothels and theatres, hospitals were pushed to the margins of society,
particularly when it came to the treatment of venereal diseases.[^2] () Ideas of morality and health, coincide with the Humors of early modern medicine theory, pushed these diseases, their respective activities, and all other taboo forms of entertainment or health care away from the inner city, to prevent the spread of diseases and ideas.

## The State and Illness: Social and Political Motivations
With the family as the microcosm of the English state, the Crown wanted to ensure the organization of family matters, in order to prevent chaos. Ideas of marriage and purity, for both genders, were essential to keeping social order. Sexual promiscuity and unmarried men or women, especially immigrant or "stateless men," were seen as a problem for the city, spreading ideas of family and sex that will disrupt families, and therefore disrupt the state.[^3]() Venereal diseases, in particular, were on the King's radar by 1600, due to their nature and relationship with sex, prostitution and extramarital affairs. Hospitals treated all *known*  forms of pathology in early modern London, but their locations were dedicated to the quarantine of infectious diseases, including the plague.    

A plague resurgence withered away London's population in 1625, reinforcing prior ideas of where the sick belong, [^4] (Plague on a Page) resulting in an emphasis on Divine Order, and the association of godly punishment for society's wrongdoings with illness. [5]() This resurfaced ideas that hospitals and illness were better further away from the city. Although, not all reasons for locating hospitals in the peripheries were necessarily bad, many thought it would be appropriate and helpful to those will *moral* illnesses, such as cancer or "hysteria" (The female illness when a woman goes too long without a husband or father's guidance, and essentially goes "crazy"). There was much concern for privacy of the patients as well, if they were of elite or noble status. Perhaps the idea of hospitals outside of the city were well intentioned and sought out the wellness of the "greater good," but early modern thoughts on hospitals prove...
