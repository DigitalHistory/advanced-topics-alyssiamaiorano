# Infectious Diseases and Ideas on the Fringes of Early Modern Society in London
#### Early Modern Royal Hospitals

The placement of early modern London hospitals are purposeful and strategic, and in line with popular opinion
regarding mental and physical illnesses. The position of these hospitals on a modern map is, perhaps, expected,
as the city has grown substantially around them since the 1530 dissolution of the monasteries. The bounds of
London expanded to include Westminster and areas below the River Thames into the modern era. In the 1530s when
Royal Hospitals, that aided the sick *and*  the criminal, after church hospitals (and all other charity programs
operated by the church) were dissolved, were founded, fears of the spread of infectious disease and plagues was
heightened. [^1]


Plagues frequently affected populations in London and across Britain, posing a threat to the growth of the "empire" that was the ever expanding English monarchy, and the absorption of what were the four countries of the British Isles, by 1625 with Charles the First of England, Third of Scotland. Plague and other infections were deemed as part of a natural order for society's behaviours. In relation to what were considered immoral illnesses, such as venereal diseases like syphilis,
commonly referred to in the period as "the French pox," or more simply "the pox" fears of disease and morality in the city of London grew. The fear of disease,
and early modern ideas of health, medicine, and morality, London moved its care to the peripheries.

The Royal Hospitals that were reinstated by the City of London were Bethlem Hospital, Saint Bartholomew, Saint Thomas, and BrideWell Hospital and Prison. These hospitals
were located at the outermost parts of London, what is now The City of London.
Situated near brothels and theatres, hospitals were pushed to the margins of society,
particularly when it came to the treatment of venereal diseases.[^2] Ideas of morality and health, coincide with the Humors of early modern medicine theory, pushed these diseases, their respective activities, and all other taboo forms of entertainment or health care away from the inner city, to prevent the spread of diseases and ideas.

## The State and Illness: Social and Political Motivations
With the family as the microcosm of the English state, the Crown wanted to ensure the organization of family matters, in order to prevent chaos. Ideas of marriage and purity, for both genders, were essential to keeping social order. Sexual promiscuity and unmarried men or women, especially immigrant or "stateless men," were seen as a problem for the city, spreading ideas of family and sex that will disrupt families, and therefore disrupt the state.[^3] Venereal diseases, in particular, were on the King's radar by 1600, due to their nature and relationship with sex, prostitution and extramarital affairs. Hospitals treated all *known*  forms of pathology in early modern London, but their locations were dedicated to the quarantine of infectious diseases, including the plague.

During 1593, one of the many plagues that would hit London in the 16th and 17th Centuries, the Royal Hospitals grew increasingly private and focused on quarantine.

A plague resurgence withered away London's population in 1625, reinforcing prior ideas of where the sick belong, [^5] resulting in an emphasis on Divine Order, and the association of godly punishment for society's wrongdoings with illness. [^6] This resurfaced ideas that hospitals and illness were better further away from the city. Although, not all reasons for locating hospitals in the peripheries were necessarily bad, many thought it would be appropriate and helpful to those will *moral* illnesses, such as cancer or "hysteria" (The female illness when a woman goes too long without a husband or father's guidance, and essentially goes "crazy"). There was much concern for privacy of the patients as well, if they were of elite or noble status. Perhaps the idea of hospitals outside of the city were well intentioned and sought out the wellness of the "greater good," with the creation of gardens in Bethlem and St. Thomas, concepts of fresh air, away from pollution of the city and its factories as beneficial for the containment and recovery of patients gained traction.

Given that these hospitals were so far removed from society they were virtually self-sustaining mini-economies.[^7] This included the BrideWell hospital and prison, showcasing early modern ideas of mental and physical illness, and criminality. These associations further pushed the ills of society (both physically ill and *morally* ill) to the outskirts. Early ideas of illness, in the form of excess of the Humors, Venereal diseases and illegitimate relations, dominated society's treatment and attitudes towards hospital patients.

Early Modern science was merely a guessing game, especially for many known and commonly treated illnesses today, but the effective quarantine of infectious diseases and often the ideas that so-called 'corrupted' the people who were affected by them, perhaps remains to be seen within the landscape of the city itself.
