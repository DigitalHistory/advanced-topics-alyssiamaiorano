The lasting effects of segregation, specifically amongst individuals like William Weaver, who were merely children attempting to navigate a world that predetermined their fate  when integration of schools began, is a rather emotional and unquantifiable history. In listening to William Weaver's experience in the American South during school integration, a seemingly positive reform, and the negative effects it had on young black students' education, the story of segregation becomes more than the decisions of Plessy v. Ferguson, or bussing in the north. The deep rooted racism of the United States and its constitution, beginning with the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, moving through the abolition and reconstruction, with lynch laws and segregation, becomes more than just spectacle when a historian can hear the voice of a man who, because of this historic institutional racism, almost had his future taken away from him. The echoes of slavery can be seen through the oral and scribal history of segregation, the 1960's in America in general, and the perceived threat black folks' rights were to white America, that was built off the exact injustices white folks were hoping to protect.  


Oral histories provide insight into traumatic ones. It is often difficult to read or analyze statistics of traumatic events, specifically ones in recent memories
for many folks, like segregation. And while traumatic histories are even harder to listen to, they are important to discuss, analyze and deviate from creating
similar circumstances. Segregation began in the early days of Jim Crow era America, around 1877, that not only restricted black folks to *black only* facilities and
institutions that were underfunded and overcrowded, these laws ensured black families were denied loans to buy homes in newly emerging white suburbs, were restricted from attending universities, and further disfranchised by their government.[^1] There is no singular story of segregation, or its adverse effects on individual African Americans, and with many generalizations about black experiences, the importance of historical accounts such as Weaver's, push the notions of blackness that reinforced segregation.

School Desegregation began in 1964 for Knoxville, Tennessee, as the Civil Rights Movement began to solidify legislation for the Voting Act, and the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) finally gaining ground on a decade long battle to prove segregation was not "separate but equal" and had psychological
effects on young students,
reinforcing the myth that black folks were inferior to white folks.[^2] These psychological effects are present to this day, and are consequences of
these deep seeded institutional legal and social remnants of slavery. The echoes of slavery were ever present in the violent and vehement defense of
segregation, the outpour of fears that whites would lose everything "once the black man became equal."[^3]
These echoes are prevalent in the treatment of Weaver, and the countless others with similar experiences.
Racism did not end when slavery did, nor did it end when integration began. The violent iterations of different forms of slavery and disfranchisement of
black folks become more nuanced, although the segregationist mentality was a form of blatant racism, the many arguments that followed "*separate but equal*" were more invidious
ways to maintain the previous social and power structures that kept black folks at a distance.
